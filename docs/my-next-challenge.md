# My name is Chase -- and I’m looking for my next challenge.

## About me:

In recent years my work has focused on transforming processes within organizations to create dramatically better outcomes. I’ve done this by implementing better technologies and realigning organizational structures. For example:

- I guided the implementation of a modern correspondence management system for the White House’s [Office of Presidential Correspondence](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/magazine/what-americans-wrote-to-obama.html?_r=0).
  - *The system is used by over 600 White House staff and volunteers to track constituent relationships. We overhauled dozens of business processes, doubling and tripling productivity.*
- I built out the operations and implemented the technical tools to support the recruiting efforts of the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov/join).
  - *We transformed a leaky, ad hoc process into a well-oiled operation, processing over 5,000 applications in the first year.*
- I helped streamline the [U.S. Refugee Admissions Program](http://www.webbyawards.com/news/how-a-small-troop-of-techies-led-the-us-syrian-refugee-surge/) through a series of technical, process, and organizational improvements—resulting in 85,000 refugee arrivals in FY2016.
  - *…despite early projections suggesting as few as 50,000 would make it in. For our work we were awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation by the Central Intelligence Agency.*

Every success has been a team effort, and I love managing teams of highly skilled, mission-driven technologists. Heck, I love managing teams in general.

Many names describe the work I do: process engineering, product management, in-house consulting, bureaucracy hacking, strategy and operations. My next challenge may go by a different name in your organization, or we may make up a new name together. Whatever the title, I’ll use my blend of technical and soft skills to implement or transform the processes your organization needs to achieve its mission.


## About you:

- You have an interesting challenge. Maybe you’re starting a new organization and need someone to help build it. Maybe you’re an older organization that wants to jump into the modern era with the help of better technology and smarter organizational dynamics.
- You make a difference. I am especially drawn to organizations that serve the public good, but I can get excited about a great product or service, too.
- You hire and empower great people. The other people in your organization are excellent, and you empower them and me to get our jobs done.
- You are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workplace, and it shows.
- You are based in D.C., or will otherwise allow me to work out of D.C. with no more than 25-35% travel.
